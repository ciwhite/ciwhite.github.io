## RESEARCH INTERESTS

My research interests lie at the intersection of people and nature. I am interested in how an understanding of ecological systems can inform adaptive management for ecosystem service provision to create Nature-based Solutions. Given that ecosystems and society are complex systems I adapt methods from complexity science, particularly graph theory, to study the magnitude and stability of ecosystem service provision. I recently initiated a project using dynamic simulations to relate the network position of a service to its stability through time and am interested in exploring a similar topic with empirical datasets.
